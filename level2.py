# First script made to test on terminal

# Challenge 2.3 String Concatenation
# Let's print the greeting G'day mate by concatenating strings and printing them to the screen.
greeting = "G'day" + ' mate'

# Challenge 2.5 Getting Started With Python strings
# Tell us about one of your favorite comedians or sketch comedy groups! Some ideas? Amy Schumer, Seinfeld, Ellen, Key & Peele, Jake and Amir, The Lonely Island â€” whatever you want.

# Challenge 2.6 - String Formatting
# Create variables named movie1 and movie2 for at least two of your favorite movies. Sorry, only ascii characters! (Remember: If there are apostrophes in the movie titles, you can use double quotes on the outside.)
movie1 = 'Gladiator'
movie2 = 'Star Wars'
# Print your favorite movies to the screen in a nicely formatted list. Use commas to separate them in the print() statement. And use newline ( \n) and tab ( \t) to format your output like so:
# My Favorite Movies:
#      A Great Movie
#      Another Good Movie
print('My Favorite Movies:\n\t', movie1, '\n\t', movie2)

# print the length of greeting

# The Man Who Only Says Ends of Words

# Using Slices to Access Parts of a String (marker at first index and then marker before last number)
word = 'Python'
word[2:5] # ==> 'tho'
word1 = 'Good'
word1[0:2] # ==> 'Go'
word1[:2] # ==> 'Go'  word1[0:2] will return same thing

# slice formula: variable[start:end+1]

# Incorporating String Slices into our solution
word1 = 'Good'
# end1 = word1[2] + word1[3] -> Not needed can just do a Slice

print(end1, end2)

# Challenge 2.9 Pythonese
# Let's create our own version of Pig Latin called Pythonese. We will take off the first letter of the word and add it to the end plus the letter 'y'. For example: Python would become ython-Py
word = 'Python'
first = word[0]
